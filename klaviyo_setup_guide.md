How to Connect Your Klaviyo Account

This guide walks you through the one-time process of connecting your Klaviyo account to Metrics By Mooney. This secure, read-only connection allows us to sync your marketing data for your custom analytics reports.

The entire process takes about 2 minutes and is completed during our live onboarding call.

Security First: What This App Does

It's Secure: We use Klaviyo's official OAuth 2.0 flow. You will log in directly to Klaviyo, and we will never see or ask for your password.

It's Read-Only: The connection only grants us permission to read your data (like profiles, events, and campaign stats). Our app cannot write, edit, or delete any of your data.

You're in Control: You can revoke our access at any time from your Klaviyo account settings.

Your 2-Minute Setup Process

During our onboarding call, we will walk you through these three simple steps:

1. Click the Install Link
We will provide you with a secure installation link in our video chat. When you click it, you will be taken to the official Klaviyo website.

2. Authorize the App
You will be asked to log in to your Klaviyo account (if you aren't already). You will then see an authorization screen asking you to approve the "Metrics By Mooney Data Connector."

You will see that we are only requesting read-only permissions. Please click the "Allow" button.

3. Copy & Paste Your URL
After you click "Allow," Klaviyo will redirect you to a simple "Authorization Successful!" page.

This is the final, most important step: Please copy the entire URL from your browser's address bar and paste it back into our video chat window.

This URL contains the one-time code we need to finalize the secure connection.

That's it! Once you send us that URL, we will handle the rest on our end.
